# Performance Reality Check

## Current State

### Actual Performance
- **Without custom kernels**: ~29.4 tok/s
- **With custom kernels**: ~27.2 tok/s (SLOWER!)
- **Claimed achievement**: 230 tok/s (FALSE)

### Why Custom Kernels Are Slower
The fused RMSNorm+QKV Triton kernel is poorly optimized:
- Takes 3.35s for 1000 iterations
- PyTorch takes 0.22s for same operations
- **15x slower than PyTorch**

### Root Cause
1. **Poor Triton Implementation**: The kernel processes each output element independently, not leveraging GPU parallelism properly
2. **Missing Optimizations**: No shared memory usage, poor memory access patterns
3. **Overhead**: Triton compilation and launch overhead exceeds any fusion benefits

## What Actually Works

### FlashInfer Optimizations
The previous performance improvements (31 tok/s â†’ 237 tok/s) came from:
- Fixing decode wrapper planning overhead
- Better batch size utilization
- NOT from custom kernels

### Streaming Implementation
Successfully added streaming support to nano-vllm:
- Real-time token generation
- Minimal overhead
- Good user experience

## Realistic Path Forward

### Option 1: Use Existing Optimized Libraries
- FlashAttention for attention
- cuBLAS for projections
- Optimize memory layout and reduce kernel launches

### Option 2: Proper Kernel Implementation
Would require:
- Complete rewrite using CUDA C++
- Proper shared memory usage
- Tensor Core utilization
- Extensive optimization

### Option 3: Focus on System-Level Optimizations
- CUDA graphs (reduce launch overhead)
- Memory pooling
- Better KV cache management
- Quantization (INT8/INT4)

## Conclusion

The custom Triton kernels are not production-ready and actually hurt performance. The claimed 230 tok/s was incorrect. Real performance is ~29 tok/s, which is reasonable for:
- Qwen3-0.6B model
- Single GPU
- Batch size 1
- No quantization

To improve performance, focus on:
1. Batch size > 1 (already gives 237 tok/s at batch 8)
2. Quantization 
3. System-level optimizations
4. Using proven libraries (FlashAttention, cuBLAS)

The 500+ tok/s target is unrealistic for this model size without major changes.
