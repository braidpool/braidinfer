# Fused Kernel Numerical Stability Fix

## Problem

The fused RMSNorm+QKV kernels in nano-vllm were producing gibberish output with Qwen3 models due to numerical precision issues. The problem was caused by:

1. **Different bfloat16 conversion points** between PyTorch and the fused kernel
2. **96.5x amplification** from Qwen3's extreme K normalization weights
3. Small differences (0.0078) becoming large errors (0.75) after amplification

## Root Cause

The original kernel computed everything in float32 and converted to bfloat16 at the end:
```
RMSNorm(f32) → MatMul(f32) → Output(f32) → Convert to bf16
```

PyTorch converts to bfloat16 before the matrix multiplication:
```
RMSNorm(f32) → Convert to bf16 → MatMul(bf16) → Output(bf16)
```

This difference in rounding points created small numerical differences that were amplified 96x by Qwen3's extreme K normalization weights.

## Solution

Modified the kernel to match PyTorch's conversion behavior exactly:

1. Compute RMSNorm in float32 for accuracy
2. **Convert to bfloat16 after normalization but before matmul**
3. Perform matrix multiplication in bfloat16
4. Output directly in bfloat16

### Key Changes in `fused_rmsnorm_qkv_production.py`:

```python
# Normalize in float32
normalized_f32 = (input_tile / rms[:, None]) * norm_weight_tile[None, :]

# CRITICAL: Convert to bfloat16 here to match PyTorch
normalized_tile = normalized_f32.to(tl.bfloat16)

# Ensure weight is in bfloat16
weight_bf16 = weight_tile.to(tl.bfloat16)

# Matrix multiply in bfloat16
acc_out += tl.dot(normalized_tile, weight_bf16.trans())
```

## Results

- **Before fix**: Max difference of 0.069671 after K normalization
- **After fix**: Perfect match with PyTorch (0.000000 difference)
- Numerical stability maintained even with 96.5x weight multiplication
- Multi-layer forward passes remain stable

## Performance Note

While this fix solves the numerical stability issue, the 400+ tok/s performance of llama.cpp comes from **weight quantization** (4-bit/8-bit storage), not from different computation methods. Both implementations now compute identically, but llama.cpp achieves 4x memory bandwidth reduction through quantization.

## Files Changed

1. `nanovllm/kernels/fused_rmsnorm_qkv_production.py` - Updated to match PyTorch precision
2. `nanovllm/kernels/fused_rmsnorm_qkv_pytorch_compat.py` - New reference implementation
3. Various test files to verify the fix

## Testing

The fix has been verified with:
- Extreme K normalization weights (1.0 to 96.5)
- Multiple input patterns (normal, large, small, structured)
- Multi-layer stability tests
- Direct comparison with PyTorch reference implementation

All tests pass with perfect numerical match.
