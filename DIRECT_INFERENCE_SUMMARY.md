# Direct Inference Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a direct inference system that bypasses chat templates and allows direct control over KV cache contents. This addresses the original issue where "the LLM is not seeing previous inputs or outputs" by maintaining conversation context through explicit block management.

## Key Components Added

### 1. VirtualSequence (`nanovllm/engine/virtual_sequence.py`)
- New sequence type that references existing KV cache blocks without reallocation
- Tracks existing blocks separately from new tokens
- Properly calculates block boundaries for mixed existing/new content

### 2. Direct Inference APIs in LLMEngine
```python
def infer_from_blocks(self, existing_blocks, existing_token_count, new_tokens=None, sampling_params=None)
def infer_from_blocks_stream(self, existing_blocks, existing_token_count, new_tokens=None, sampling_params=None)
```

### 3. BlockManager Updates
- Added `_allocate_virtual()` method to handle VirtualSequence allocation
- Proper reference counting for shared blocks
- Support for deallocating only owned blocks

### 4. CLI Integration
- Modified main chat loop to use direct inference for subsequent messages
- First message uses traditional chat template
- Subsequent messages use direct inference with conversation history
- Added `/infer` command for manual direct inference

### 5. Context Manager Helpers
```python
def get_conversation_blocks(self) -> tuple[list[int], int]
def get_all_active_blocks(self) -> tuple[list[int], int]
```

## How It Works

1. **First Message**: Uses traditional chat template approach
2. **Conversation Tracking**: Creates chunks for user input and model output
3. **Subsequent Messages**: 
   - Retrieves existing conversation blocks from context manager
   - Creates VirtualSequence with existing blocks + new tokens
   - Runs inference without reallocating existing KV cache entries

## Benefits

1. **Full Control**: Direct control over what's in the KV cache
2. **No Hidden Allocations**: All allocations are explicit and visible
3. **Memory Efficient**: Reuses existing blocks without copying
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation history across turns

## Current Issues

1. **Model Output Quality**: The model produces gibberish when using direct inference, suggesting potential issues with:
   - Attention mask computation
   - Position embeddings
   - Block ordering or token alignment

2. **Infinite Generation**: The model doesn't properly stop generating, indicating possible issues with:
   - EOS token handling in virtual sequences
   - Sampling parameters propagation

## Next Steps

To fully resolve the original issue, the following should be addressed:

1. Debug why model output quality degrades with virtual sequences
2. Ensure proper attention masking for mixed existing/new blocks
3. Verify position embeddings are correctly computed
4. Add proper EOS token handling for virtual sequences
5. Add comprehensive tests for various conversation patterns

## Usage Example

```python
# Direct inference with existing blocks
blocks, token_count = context_mgr.get_conversation_blocks()
result = llm.infer_from_blocks(
    existing_blocks=blocks,
    existing_token_count=token_count,
    new_tokens=tokenizer.encode("What was discussed?"),
    sampling_params=SamplingParams(max_tokens=100)
)
```

The implementation provides the foundation for direct KV cache control, addressing the architectural issue where chat templates were creating new sequences that didn't reference conversation history.
