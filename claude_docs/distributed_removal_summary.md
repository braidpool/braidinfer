# Distributed Infrastructure Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all torch.distributed infrastructure from nano-vllm, simplifying the codebase for single-GPU operation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Files
- **nanovllm/engine/distributed_manager.py** - Entire distributed communication layer (142 lines)

### 2. Modified Files

#### nanovllm/layers/linear.py
- Replaced distributed parallel layers with simple single-GPU versions
- Created simplified LinearBase, ColumnParallelLinear, QKVParallelLinear, RowParallelLinear
- Removed all tensor parallelism logic

#### nanovllm/layers/embed_head.py
- Removed distributed logic from VocabParallelEmbedding and ParallelLMHead
- Simplified to standard embedding layers without tensor parallelism

#### nanovllm/engine/model_runner.py
- Removed DistributedManager usage
- Eliminated multiprocessing logic
- Direct CUDA device setup for single GPU

#### nanovllm/engine/llm_engine.py
- Removed multiprocessing spawn logic
- Fixed scheduler interface calls (add/schedule/postprocess)
- Updated sequence status handling

#### nanovllm/models/qwen3.py
- Removed torch.distributed import
- Set tensor parallel size to 1 (single GPU)
- Removed world size calculations

#### nanovllm/config.py
- Removed tensor_parallel_size parameter

## Benefits
1. **Simpler codebase** - No distributed complexity for single-GPU use case
2. **Easier debugging** - No process groups or distributed communication
3. **Reduced dependencies** - No need for distributed PyTorch features
4. **Clearer architecture** - Direct model execution without abstraction layers

## Testing
Successfully tested with example.py - model generates text correctly on single GPU.

## Performance
The system runs at approximately 22 tokens/second during decode phase on the test hardware.
