# Cascade Attention Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a compositional context caching system using FlashInfer's Cascade Attention mechanism. This allows efficient composition of multiple context chunks (system prompts, RAG results, code snippets) with content-based deduplication and multi-head attention support.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Context Chunk System (`nanovllm/engine/context_chunks.py`)
- **ContextChunk**: Core data structure with SHA256-based identity
- **ChunkType**: Enum for system_prompt, context, query, rag_result, code
- **ChunkComposition**: Organizes chunks into cascade levels
- **Multi-head support**: Stores per-head attention states (V, S)

### 2. Cascade Page Manager (`nanovllm/engine/cascade_page_manager.py`)
- Extends PageManager with persistent chunk storage
- Separate page pools for chunks (50%) vs dynamic generation (50%)
- Reference counting for shared chunks
- Supports building multi-level cascade indices

### 3. Cascade Attention Layer (`nanovllm/layers/cascade_attention.py`)
- Uses FlashInfer's `MultiLevelCascadeAttentionWrapper`
- Supports up to 3 cascade levels by default
- Handles both prefill and decode phases
- Compatible with multi-head and grouped query attention (GQA)

### 4. Cascade Wrapper Manager (`nanovllm/engine/cascade_wrapper_manager.py`)
- Extends WrapperManager with cascade support
- Creates and manages cascade wrappers per layer
- Handles cascade configuration and planning
- Provides attention state merging utilities

### 5. Chunk Registry (`nanovllm/engine/chunk_registry.py`)
- Global registry with LRU eviction policy
- Content-based deduplication via SHA256 hashing
- Thread-safe operations
- Optional disk persistence
- Memory-aware eviction when pages are needed

## How It Works

### Cascade Levels Structure
1. **Level 0**: Shared system prompts (same for all sequences in batch)
2. **Level 1**: Context chunks (documents, code, RAG results)
3. **Level 2**: User-specific queries and generation

### Multi-Head Attention Support
- Each chunk stores attention states per head:
  - V: `[seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]`
  - S: `[seq_len, num_heads]` (logsumexp for numerical stability)
- Merging happens independently per attention head
- Supports Qwen3's configuration (32 heads, or different QO/KV head counts for GQA)

### Example Usage

```python
# Register reusable chunks
registry = get_global_registry()
system_chunk = registry.register(
    "You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in Python.",
    ChunkType.SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    tokenizer=tokenizer
)

code_chunk = registry.register(
    source_code,
    ChunkType.CODE,
    tokenizer=tokenizer
)

# Build composition
builder = ChunkBuilder()
composition = builder.build_composition(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    context_chunks=[source_code, documentation],
    query="Explain this function"
)

# The scheduler would then create cascade configurations
# and the attention layer would use cascade wrappers
```

## Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Shared chunks stored once, referenced by multiple sequences
2. **Speed**: Pre-computed attention states can be merged without recomputation
3. **Flexibility**: Mix and match different context components
4. **Scalability**: Supports many concurrent requests with shared context
5. **Multi-Head Support**: Each head maintains independent attention patterns

## Architecture Advantages

- **Clean Separation**: Chunks, page management, and attention are decoupled
- **Thread Safety**: Registry uses proper locking for concurrent access
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new chunk types or cascade levels
- **Performance**: Leverages FlashInfer's optimized cascade kernels

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with Scheduler**: Update the scheduler to create cascade-aware batches
2. **Pre-compute Chunk States**: Add mechanism to pre-compute and cache attention states
3. **Optimize Cascade Levels**: Experiment with different level configurations
4. **Add Persistence**: Implement saving/loading of pre-computed states
5. **Benchmark Performance**: Compare against baseline attention
