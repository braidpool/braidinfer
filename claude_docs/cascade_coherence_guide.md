# Cascade Attention Coherence Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how the cascade attention implementation ensures coherent output when composing multiple context chunks. The key is that cascade attention maintains the same mathematical properties as standard attention while optimizing memory usage.

## How Cascade Attention Maintains Coherence

### 1. Mathematical Equivalence

The cascade attention mechanism uses FlashInfer's merge operations which are mathematically equivalent to computing attention over the full concatenated sequence:

```python
# These produce identical results:
# Method 1: Standard attention over full sequence
attn_output = attention(Q, [K1, K2, K3], [V1, V2, V3])

# Method 2: Cascade attention with merging
output1, lse1 = attention(Q, K1, V1, return_lse=True)
output2, lse2 = attention(Q, K2, V2, return_lse=True)
output3, lse3 = attention(Q, K3, V3, return_lse=True)
attn_output = merge_states([output1, output2, output3], [lse1, lse2, lse3])
```

### 2. Per-Head Independence

Each attention head maintains its own attention pattern:
- Attention states shape: `[seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]`
- LogSumExp shape: `[seq_len, num_heads]`
- Merging happens independently per head

### 3. Order Preservation

The cascade levels preserve semantic ordering:
- **Level 0**: System prompts (establish behavior)
- **Level 1**: Context information (provide knowledge)
- **Level 2**: User queries (specify task)

## Testing Coherence

### Test Suite Components

1. **`test_cascade_coherence.py`**: Basic coherence verification
   - Tests with fictional entities the model doesn't know
   - Verifies correct information extraction
   - Compares cascade vs non-cascade outputs

2. **`example_cascade_inference.py`**: Simple inference examples
   - Tests with irrelevant context (should be ignored)
   - Tests with duplicate context (should not affect output)
   - Tests with reordered context

3. **`example_thorough.py`**: Comprehensive testing
   - Various context arrangements
   - Batch processing coherence
   - Conflicting information handling

### Example Test Case

```python
# Fictional context the model wouldn't know
context = """
Dr. Elara Moonwhisper founded Zephyrix Technologies in 2019 
in Crystalton, Nebulonia. The company employs 127 researchers.
"""

# With irrelevant context
irrelevant = "The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s."

# Question requiring specific information
question = "How many researchers work at Zephyrix Technologies?"

# Expected: Model extracts "127" despite irrelevant context
```

## Ensuring Coherence in Production

### 1. Chunk Design Best Practices

```python
# Good: Self-contained chunks
system_chunk = "You are a helpful assistant. Answer based on provided context."
context_chunk = "Product X costs $99 and comes in red, blue, and green."
query_chunk = "What colors does Product X come in?"

# Bad: Incomplete chunks that depend on each other
chunk1 = "The product costs"  # Incomplete
chunk2 = "$99 and comes in"   # Fragment
chunk3 = "red, blue, green"   # No context
```

### 2. Context Ordering

While cascade attention is mathematically order-invariant, semantic ordering matters:

```python
# Recommended order
composition = ChunkBuilder().build_composition(
    system_prompt=system,    # First: establish behavior
    context_chunks=contexts, # Second: provide information
    query=user_query        # Last: specify task
)
```

### 3. Handling Conflicts

When contexts contain conflicting information:

```python
context1 = "The facility employs 342 researchers."
context2 = "Reports claim 500 researchers work there."
system = "If you find conflicting information, mention both values."
```

### 4. Deduplication Benefits

Cascade attention automatically deduplicates identical chunks:

```python
# These contexts will be stored only once
prompts = [
    "Context: Python is interpreted.\nQ: Is Python compiled?",
    "Context: Python is interpreted.\nQ: Is Python fast?",
    "Context: Python is interpreted.\nQ: Why use Python?"
]
# The "Python is interpreted" context is stored once, used 3 times
```

## Monitoring Coherence

### Key Metrics

1. **Response Accuracy**: Does output contain expected information?
2. **Context Isolation**: Is irrelevant context ignored?
3. **Batch Consistency**: Do batched requests maintain quality?
4. **Deduplication Rate**: How much memory is saved?

### Example Monitoring Code

```python
def verify_coherence(prompts, expected_contents):
    outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)
    
    coherence_scores = []
    for output, expected in zip(outputs, expected_contents):
        response = output["text"]
        score = 1.0 if expected.lower() in response.lower() else 0.0
        coherence_scores.append(score)
    
    return {
        "mean_coherence": sum(coherence_scores) / len(coherence_scores),
        "all_coherent": all(s == 1.0 for s in coherence_scores),
        "failed_indices": [i for i, s in enumerate(coherence_scores) if s < 1.0]
    }
```

## Troubleshooting Coherence Issues

### Issue: Responses ignore context

**Solution**: Check cascade level assignment
```python
# Verify context is at appropriate level
levels = composition.get_cascade_levels()
print(f"Level assignment: {[(i, [c.chunk_type for c in level]) for i, level in enumerate(levels)]}")
```

### Issue: Inconsistent batch results

**Solution**: Ensure sequences grouped by shared chunks
```python
# Scheduler should group sequences with same chunks
scheduler = CascadeScheduler(config)
# Groups sequences by shared chunk signatures
```

### Issue: Memory not being saved

**Solution**: Verify deduplication working
```python
stats = chunk_registry.get_stats()
print(f"Hit rate: {stats['hit_rate']*100:.1f}%")
print(f"Unique chunks: {stats['current_chunks']}")
```

## Conclusion

Cascade attention maintains coherence through:
1. Mathematical equivalence to standard attention
2. Per-head attention patterns
3. Proper context organization
4. Automatic deduplication

The test suite verifies these properties with fictional contexts, ensuring the model produces coherent outputs regardless of context arrangement, duplication, or irrelevant information.
