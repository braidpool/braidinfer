# Honest Performance Summary

## Executive Summary

nano-vllm achieves **~29 tokens/second** at batch size 1 on Qwen3-0.6B. Custom Triton kernels made performance worse. The previously claimed 230 tok/s was incorrect.

## Actual Performance Numbers

### Batch Size 1 (Single User)
- **Standard PyTorch**: 29.4 tok/s ✓
- **With Custom Kernels**: 27.2 tok/s ✗
- **Previously Claimed**: 230 tok/s (FALSE)

### Batch Size 8
- **Standard Implementation**: ~237 tok/s ✓
- **Bottleneck**: GPU memory and compute fully utilized

## Why Custom Kernels Failed

### RMSNorm + QKV Fusion
- **Expected**: 1.5x speedup
- **Actual**: 15x SLOWER
- **Reason**: Poor Triton implementation, no GPU parallelism

### MLP Fusion
- **Expected**: 1.3x speedup
- **Actual**: 17-29x SLOWER
- **Reason**: Computed full GEMM per output element

### O_Proj + Residual Fusion
- **Expected**: 1.1x speedup
- **Actual**: 2.2x SLOWER
- **Reason**: No Tensor Core usage, poor memory patterns

## Root Causes

1. **Fundamental misunderstanding of GPU programming**
   - Kernels process elements independently
   - No shared memory optimization
   - Poor memory access patterns

2. **Triton limitations**
   - High overhead for simple operations
   - Difficult to match cuBLAS optimizations
   - Compilation overhead

3. **Unrealistic expectations**
   - 500+ tok/s target impossible for this model
   - Even perfect optimization caps at ~250 tok/s

## What Actually Works

### ✓ FlashInfer Integration
- Efficient attention implementation
- Good batch processing
- Handles KV cache well

### ✓ Streaming Support
- Real-time token generation
- Minimal overhead
- Good user experience

### ✓ Multi-batch Performance
- 237 tok/s at batch 8
- Good GPU utilization
- Scales well with batch size

## Realistic Optimization Path

### 1. Quantization (Most Promising)
- **INT8**: 2x speedup → ~60 tok/s
- **INT4**: 3-4x speedup → ~90-120 tok/s
- **Tools**: bitsandbytes, GPTQ, AWQ

### 2. System Optimizations
- **Memory pooling**: 10-15% improvement
- **KV cache optimization**: 5-10% improvement
- **CUDA graphs**: Limited by FlashInfer

### 3. Remove Custom Kernels
- **Delete**: Triton implementations
- **Use**: cuBLAS, cuDNN, FlashAttention
- **Result**: Return to baseline performance

## Performance Targets (Realistic)

### Current State
- Single user: 29 tok/s
- Batch 8: 237 tok/s

### Achievable (6 months)
- Quantized single user: 60-120 tok/s
- Optimized batch: 300+ tok/s
- With all optimizations: 150 tok/s single user

### Not Achievable
- 500+ tok/s (original target)
- 230 tok/s at batch 1 (false claim)
- Benefits from current Triton kernels

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure accurately** - False claims hurt credibility
2. **Understand baselines** - PyTorch/cuBLAS are highly optimized
3. **Profile first** - Don't optimize the wrong things
4. **Be realistic** - Hardware has limits

## Recommendations

### Immediate (1 week)
1. Disable custom kernels in production
2. Document real performance numbers
3. Set realistic expectations

### Short term (1 month)
1. Implement INT8 quantization
2. Optimize memory allocation
3. Profile actual bottlenecks

### Long term (3-6 months)
1. Explore model distillation
2. Consider different architectures
3. Focus on multi-user scenarios

## Conclusion

nano-vllm performs reasonably well at **29 tok/s** for single-user inference. This is competitive for a full-precision Qwen3-0.6B model. The custom kernel attempts failed, but the system architecture is sound. Focus should shift to proven optimization techniques like quantization rather than custom kernel development.

The 500+ tok/s target was unrealistic from the start. A more reasonable target is 100-150 tok/s with quantization and system optimizations.
