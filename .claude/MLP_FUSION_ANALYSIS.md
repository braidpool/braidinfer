# MLP Fusion Analysis - Understanding the Failure

## The Problem

My fused kernels are 280-760x slower than separate operations. This is a catastrophic failure that indicates fundamental misunderstanding.

## What I Did Wrong

1. **Sequential Processing**: My kernels process intermediate dimensions sequentially in loops
2. **No Parallelism**: Each thread block computes entire reductions instead of cooperating
3. **Repeated Memory Access**: Loading the same data multiple times
4. **Wrong Algorithm**: Trying to fuse at the wrong granularity

## Why cuBLAS is Fast

cuBLAS GEMMs for our case (M=1, N=896, K=4864):
- Use Tensor Cores (8x throughput)
- Optimal memory access patterns
- Highly tuned for different matrix sizes
- Parallel reduction across warps

## The Correct Approach

For batch size 1 MLP fusion, we need:

### 1. Proper Work Distribution
```
- Split output (N) across thread blocks
- Split intermediate (K) within each block
- Use shared memory for input vector
- Cooperative reduction within warps
```

### 2. Memory Access Pattern
```
Input x: Load ONCE into shared memory
Weights: Stream through in coalesced manner
Output: Each thread accumulates its portion
```

### 3. Fusion Strategy
```
Instead of: x → gate_up → hidden → output
Do: For each output element, stream through K dimension
    computing gate*silu*up*down in registers
```

## Why My Approach Failed

Looking at my kernel:
```python
for k_base in range(0, K, BLOCK_SIZE):  # Sequential!
    # Compute gate and up for chunk
    for n_base in range(0, N, BLOCK_SIZE):  # Nested sequential!
        # Load and compute
```

This is O(K × N) sequential operations per thread block!

## The Real Lesson

**Fusion is not always the answer for modern GPUs with Tensor Cores.**

For small batch GEMM operations:
- Kernel launch overhead: ~5-10 μs
- cuBLAS GEMM time: ~20 μs (using Tensor Cores)
- Memory bandwidth: Not saturated

The overhead is 25-50% of compute time, not 62% as initially calculated.

## Recommendations

1. **Use cuBLAS**: It's optimized for exactly this case
2. **Focus on other bottlenecks**: Attention mechanism, memory layout
3. **CUDA Graphs alternative**: Since FlashInfer incompatible, consider:
   - Persistent kernels for attention
   - Custom batch-1 attention kernel
   - Memory layout optimization

## Next Best Optimization Target

Based on the bottleneck analysis:
1. **Attention output fusion**: 5-10% gain, low risk
2. **Custom batch-1 attention**: 20-30% gain, replaces FlashInfer overhead
3. **Memory layout optimization**: 5-10% gain, improves cache usage
