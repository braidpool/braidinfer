# Sprint Summary: Custom KV Cache Implementation

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
1. **Fixed Custom KV Cache Writing**
   - Implemented `append_to_paged_kv_cache_custom` in `kv_cache_utils.py`
   - Fixed position calculation to account for existing KV cache
   - Removed all FlashInfer usage from PageManager

2. **Fixed Triton Kernel Compilation**
   - Removed unsupported `continue` statements
   - Fixed chained boolean operators
   - Added proper bounds checking with `max_pages` parameter
   - Fixed layer slice access to avoid stride issues

3. **Fixed Active Chunks for Prefill**
   - Modified `llm_engine.py` to use active_chunks during both prefill and decode
   - Fixed "K shape mismatch: 3 != 513" error
   - Custom chunk kernel now properly handles decode operations

4. **Removed FlashInfer Dependencies**
   - Removed `import flashinfer` from `page_manager.py`
   - Removed all `flashinfer.page.append_paged_kv_cache` calls
   - Removed `use_custom_chunk_kernel` parameter throughout
   - Always use custom implementation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
1. **Custom kernel only supports decode (single token)**
   - Prefill with multiple tokens falls back to standard attention
   - Would need a separate prefill kernel to fully support custom chunks

2. **FlashInfer still present in other components**
   - `model_runner.py` still imports FlashInfer
   - `attention.py` still imports FlashInfer
   - `FlashInferCascadeAttention` layer still exists
   - Would need more work to completely remove FlashInfer

### üéØ Current Status
- The system now works with custom chunk attention for decode
- Text generation is successful with the custom kernel
- Performance appears good (3689.8 tok/s reported)
- The original goal of fixing KV cache management is achieved

## Key Technical Details

### Memory Layout
- Using HND layout: [num_pages, 2, num_heads, page_size, head_dim]
- Page size: 256 tokens
- Proper stride calculations for paged memory access

### Custom Kernel Features
- Direct paged KV cache access without memory copies
- Online softmax algorithm for memory efficiency
- GQA (Grouped Query Attention) support
- Bounds checking to prevent CUDA errors

## Next Steps (Future Sprint)
1. Implement custom prefill kernel for multi-token support
2. Remove remaining FlashInfer dependencies
3. Create custom cascade attention implementation
4. Optimize performance further
