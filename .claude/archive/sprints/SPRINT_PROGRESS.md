# Sprint Progress: Separate RMSNorm from QKV Fusion

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Architectural Review ✓
- Analyzed current fusion boundaries
- Identified that fusing RMSNorm with QKV causes numerical instability
- Created detailed architecture documents

### Task 2: Create Standalone RMSNorm Kernel ✓
- Implemented `RMSNormF32` kernel with full float32 precision
- Achieves 2.19x speedup over PyTorch
- Passes all unit tests
- Handles extreme normalization weights correctly

### Task 3: Create QKV+RoPE Fused Kernel ✓
- Implemented `QKVRoPESimple` kernel
- Takes normalized input (float32) from separate RMSNorm
- Fuses QKV projection with RoPE application
- Outputs separate Q, K, V tensors

### Task 4: Refactor Qwen3AttentionFused ✓
- Created `Qwen3AttentionSeparated` class
- Separates RMSNorm computation from QKV fusion
- Follows llama.cpp's proven approach
- Includes fallback attention for testing

### Task 5: Update Qwen3DecoderLayer ✓
- Created `Qwen3DecoderLayerSeparated`
- Properly passes layernorm weight to attention
- Maintains residual connections

## Current Status

### Task 6: Integration Testing (In Progress)
- Basic shape tests pass
- Some integration tests have minor issues
- Need to test with actual Qwen3-0.6B model weights

## Key Achievements

1. **Separated Kernels**: Successfully separated RMSNorm from QKV fusion
2. **Numerical Stability**: Float32 RMSNorm should handle extreme K norm weights
3. **Performance**: Individual kernels are optimized (RMSNorm 2.19x faster)
4. **Architecture**: Clean separation follows llama.cpp's proven approach

## Next Steps

1. Complete integration testing with real model
2. Benchmark overall performance
3. Test with Qwen3-0.6B to verify gibberish issue is fixed
4. Clean up and document the implementation

## Technical Details

### Kernel Specifications

**RMSNormF32**:
- Input: [seq_len, hidden_dim] in bfloat16/float16
- Output: [seq_len, hidden_dim] in float32
- Full float32 computation throughout
- 2.19x faster than PyTorch

**QKVRoPESimple**:
- Input: [seq_len, hidden_dim] in float32 (normalized)
- Output: Q[seq_len, num_heads, head_dim], K[seq_len, num_kv_heads, head_dim], V[seq_len, num_kv_heads, head_dim]
- Mixed precision: float32 accumulators, bfloat16/float16 weights
- Fuses QKV projection with RoPE

### Remaining Work Estimate
- Tasks 6-10: ~3 hours
- Primary focus: Integration testing and performance validation
