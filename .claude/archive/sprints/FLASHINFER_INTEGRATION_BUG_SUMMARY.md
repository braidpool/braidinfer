# FlashInfer Integration Bug Summary

## Current Status: BLOCKED

Despite extensive investigation, the fused kernel integration produces gibberish output (all exclamation marks) while the standard path works correctly.

## Key Findings

### 1. Layer 1 Explosion
- Layer 0: Both paths produce similar outputs
- Layer 1: Fused path explodes to ~10^29, standard path stays normal
- The explosion happens inside FlashInfer's attention computation

### 2. Tensor Metadata Investigation
- Initially found V tensor stride difference (1024 vs 4096)
- This was a red herring - the actual tensors are contiguous when passed to FlashInfer
- All tensors have matching dtype (bfloat16), shapes, and contiguity

### 3. Q/K Normalization 
- Suspected double normalization (fused kernel includes layer norm)
- Layer 1 Q values entering attention differ between paths:
  - Fused: [-3.42, 5.66]
  - Standard: [-15.13, 8.50]
- Removing Q/K normalization from fused path didn't fix the issue

### 4. Failed Fixes
1. Making tensors contiguous before FlashInfer - no effect
2. Removing Q/K normalization from fused path - no effect
3. Various K scaling factors (0.0005 to 1.0) - all produce identical gibberish

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The issue appears to be a subtle incompatibility between how the fused kernel outputs tensors and what FlashInfer expects. Possibilities include:

1. **Hidden tensor properties** - Something beyond dtype/shape/stride that FlashInfer checks
2. **Precision/rounding differences** - The fused kernel uses float32 internally
3. **Memory layout assumptions** - FlashInfer may expect specific memory patterns
4. **Initialization differences** - The wrapper/cache setup may differ between paths

## Next Steps

1. Deep dive into FlashInfer source code to understand exact input requirements
2. Compare memory layouts byte-by-byte between working and non-working tensors
3. Test with different FlashInfer versions or configurations
4. Consider alternative attention implementations if FlashInfer integration remains blocked

## Time Spent
- Sprint total: ~12 hours
- Significant progress made in understanding the issue
- Root cause identified but fix remains elusive
