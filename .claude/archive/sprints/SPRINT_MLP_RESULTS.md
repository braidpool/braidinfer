# MLP Fusion Sprint Results

## Sprint Objective
Implement MLP fusion to reduce kernel launches and improve performance.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Bottleneck Analysis ✅
- Identified kernel launch overhead as primary bottleneck (45-62% of time)
- Found 360 kernel launches per token
- MLP operations account for 40% of compute time

### 2. MLP Kernel Design ✅
- Designed fused kernel combining gate_proj + up_proj + SiLU + down_proj
- Created multiple implementations:
  - `fused_mlp_simple.py` - Basic implementation
  - `fused_mlp_optimized.py` - Optimized with better memory access
  - Both handle fp16 numerical stability

### 3. Integration ✅
- Added `use_custom_kernels` support to `Qwen3MLP`
- Integrated kernel selection logic
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 4. Testing ✅
- Verified correctness (<0.001 difference)
- Comprehensive benchmarking revealed performance issues

## Performance Results

**NEGATIVE RESULT**: Fused MLP kernel is 17-29x SLOWER than separate operations

```
Standard MLP: 0.077 ms (using cuBLAS GEMMs)
Fused MLP (optimized): 21.472 ms
Fused MLP (simple): 35.321 ms

Speedup: 0.06x (massive regression)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Redundant Computation**: Triton kernels compute full GEMM for each output element
2. **Missing Tensor Cores**: cuBLAS GEMMs leverage Tensor Cores, Triton doesn't
3. **Poor Memory Pattern**: Accessing full weight matrices repeatedly
4. **Small Batch Size**: B=1 limits parallelism opportunities

## Key Learnings

1. **Not all fusion is beneficial** - Well-optimized operations (cuBLAS GEMM) are hard to beat
2. **Hardware matters** - Tensor Cores make unfused GEMMs extremely efficient
3. **Profile first** - Initial bottleneck analysis was correct but solution was wrong
4. **Triton limitations** - Not always the right tool for the job

## Decision

**DO NOT USE FUSED MLP KERNEL** - Performance regression too severe

## Alternative Approaches

1. **CUDA Graphs**: Capture operation sequences to reduce launch overhead
2. **Persistent Kernels**: Keep data in shared memory between operations
3. **Focus elsewhere**: Attention mechanisms have more optimization potential

## Files Created/Modified

- Created: `nanovllm/kernels/fused_mlp_optimized.py` (kept for reference)
- Created: `.claude/MLP_FUSION_FINDINGS.md` (detailed analysis)
- Modified: `nanovllm/models/qwen3.py` (reverted to standard implementation)
- Cleaned up: All test files and intermediate kernel versions

## Next Steps

Based on learnings, recommend:
1. Explore CUDA graphs for kernel launch reduction
2. Focus on attention optimizations (output fusion, better memory layout)
3. Consider FlashInfer integration for advanced attention kernels
