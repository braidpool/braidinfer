# Sprint Status: Fix Numerical Instability in Fused Attention Kernel

## Sprint Goal
Find and fix the numerical instability in the fused kernel's attention calculation.

## Status: BLOCKED

### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ **Isolated and Analyzed the Softmax Input** (4 hours)
   - Found that Layer 1 explodes to 10^29
   - Identified that K values are reasonable (max ~1.8 with scaling)
   - Discovered that ALL K scaling factors produce the same issue
   - Proved that softmax overflow is NOT the root cause

2. ✅ **Investigated K Scaling Solutions** (3 hours)
   - Implemented K scaling from 0.0005 to 1.0
   - All scales produce identical gibberish output
   - Even with no scaling, issue persists
   - Conclusion: K magnitude is not the problem

3. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis** (2 hours)
   - Layer 1 attention produces infinity regardless of inputs
   - Issue is in FlashInfer integration, not our kernels
   - Standard path works fine with same model weights

### Blocked Task

❌ **Implement a Numerically Stable Softmax**
- Cannot modify FlashInfer's internal softmax
- K scaling doesn't help as the issue is elsewhere
- The suggested solution doesn't address the real problem

## Key Discovery

The issue is NOT softmax overflow. The problem appears to be a fundamental incompatibility between how our fused kernel path interacts with FlashInfer, possibly related to:
- Tensor shapes/layouts
- Precision handling
- KV cache population
- Batching differences

## Recommendation

This sprint's approach is incorrect. We need a new sprint focused on:
1. Debugging the FlashInfer integration
2. Comparing exact tensor formats between standard and fused paths
3. Investigating alternative attention implementations

The fused kernel optimization should be put on hold until we understand why FlashInfer behaves differently with our inputs.
