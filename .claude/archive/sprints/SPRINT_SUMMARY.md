# Sprint Summary: Batch Size 1 Optimization

## Sprint Goal
Optimize nano-vllm for single-user scenarios to achieve >500 tokens/s at batch size 1

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Root Cause Analysis ✅
- Identified that CPU overhead from 1,572 tensor operations per forward pass is the bottleneck
- GPU utilization is only 10% (3.3ms GPU time vs 32ms total)
- Main culprits: `.to()` calls (676), `.view()` calls (672), `.unsqueeze()` calls (224)

### 2. Optimizations Implemented ✅

#### RMSNorm Optimization
- Eliminated unnecessary dtype conversions for bfloat16
- Reduced `.to()` calls from 676 to 236 (65% reduction)
- Performance: 30.3 → 32.3 tok/s (7% improvement)

#### torch.compile Integration
- Added configuration options for torch.compile
- Implemented support for different modes and backends
- Found incompatibility with FlashInfer's dynamic code generation

#### Static Memory Pool
- Created `StaticMemoryPool` class for pre-allocated buffers
- Designed to eliminate allocation overhead during inference
- Infrastructure ready but not yet integrated

#### CUDA Graph Preparation
- Fixed FlashInfer wrapper state management issues
- Made PageManager partially CUDA graph compatible
- Created graph-safe operation helpers

#### Optimized Components
- Created optimized rotary embedding implementation
- Reduced unnecessary tensor operations
- Prepared for batch size 1 fast path

### 3. Current Performance
- Baseline: ~31 tok/s (batch size 1)
- With optimizations: ~32 tok/s
- Target: 500+ tok/s
- Gap: Still need ~15x improvement

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. CUDA Graph Complexity
- FlashInfer's dynamic operations are not graph-safe
- Tensor creation during graph capture causes errors
- Need comprehensive refactoring of page management

### 2. torch.compile Limitations
- Incompatible with FlashInfer's wrapper.extend() method
- Dynamic code generation prevents full graph compilation
- Limited benefit without addressing FlashInfer integration

### 3. System Complexity
- Many interdependent components
- Each optimization requires careful integration
- Trade-offs between flexibility and performance

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 2)
1. **Complete CUDA Graph Implementation**
   - Create fully graph-safe page management
   - Implement specialized batch size 1 runner
   - Handle all dynamic operations outside graph

2. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Consider custom CUDA kernels for critical paths
   - Explore kernel fusion opportunities
   - Investigate other attention implementations

3. **Profiling and Analysis**
   - Use NVIDIA Nsight for detailed GPU profiling
   - Identify remaining CPU bottlenecks
   - Measure impact of each optimization

### Future Considerations
1. **Custom Attention Kernel**
   - Implement fused attention for batch size 1
   - Eliminate intermediate tensor operations
   - Direct integration with KV cache

2. **AOT Compilation**
   - Pre-compile model for specific configurations
   - Eliminate all runtime overhead
   - Static shape specialization

3. **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**
   - Tune for specific GPU architectures
   - Utilize tensor cores more effectively
   - Optimize memory access patterns

## Lessons Learned

1. **CPU overhead dominates in small batch scenarios**
   - Every tensor operation matters
   - Python loop overhead is significant
   - Need to minimize host-device synchronization

2. **CUDA graphs require careful design**
   - All operations must be deterministic
   - No dynamic memory allocation allowed
   - Complex systems need significant refactoring

3. **Incremental improvements add up**
   - 7% from RMSNorm optimization
   - More gains possible from other components
   - But need major architectural changes for 15x

## Recommendations

1. **For immediate deployment**: Use current optimizations for ~7% improvement
2. **For significant gains**: Complete CUDA graph implementation
3. **For maximum performance**: Consider custom kernels or alternative frameworks
