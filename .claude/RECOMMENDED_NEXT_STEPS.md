# Recommended Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Document the Integration Issue
Create a detailed bug report with minimal reproducible example for:
- FlashInfer maintainers
- Future debugging efforts
- Include all tensor comparisons and findings

### 2. Proceed with Quantization Sprint
Given that custom kernels are blocked, quantization offers the best path to performance:
- INT8/INT4 quantization can provide 2-4x speedup
- Well-tested integration with existing libraries
- No FlashInfer compatibility issues

### 3. Alternative Attention Implementation
Consider testing with:
- Flash Attention 2 (instead of FlashInfer)
- xFormers
- Native PyTorch scaled_dot_product_attention
- Custom Triton attention kernel

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. Deep FlashInfer Analysis
- Study FlashInfer source code in detail
- Understand exact tensor requirements
- Compare with other successful integrations

### 2. Hybrid Approach
- Use custom kernels for layers that work
- Fall back to standard path for problematic layers
- Selective optimization based on stability

### 3. Different Fusion Strategy
- Instead of fusing RMSNorm+QKV, try other fusions:
  - Attention + output projection
  - MLP components (with better implementation)
  - Layer-wise fusions

## Performance Without Custom Kernels

Current: ~29 tok/s
With quantization: 60-120 tok/s (expected)
With system optimizations: 35-40 tok/s (expected)

The quantization approach offers the best ROI given the current blockers.
