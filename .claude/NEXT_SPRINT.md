# Next Sprint: Fix KV Cache State Mismatch in Chunked Generation

## Sprint Goal
Investigate and fix the root cause of why chunked generation produces different KV cache states than standard generation, leading to incorrect output.

## Background
The cascade attention implementation correctly handles position encodings but the generated output is still nonsensical. This indicates the problem is deeper than position handling - the KV cache states computed during isolated chunk prefill differ from those in continuous generation.

## Root Cause Hypothesis
1. **Context-Dependent Computations**: Layer normalization, attention patterns, and hidden states depend on the full context, not just isolated chunks
2. **Tokenization Boundaries**: Chunk boundaries may not align with natural language boundaries
3. **Missing Initialization**: Chunks prefilled in isolation start from different initial hidden states

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Deep Investigation
- [ ] **Compare KV Cache Values**:
  - Implement debugging to dump actual K and V values
  - Compare values between standard and chunked generation
  - Identify where values start to diverge

- [ ] **Trace Hidden State Evolution**:
  - Track hidden states through layers in both modes
  - Compare layer norm statistics
  - Identify context-dependent computations

- [ ] **Analyze Chunk Prefill Process**:
  - Review how chunks are prefilled in isolation
  - Check initial hidden states and positions
  - Verify RoPE application during prefill

### Phase 2: Fix Approaches
- [ ] **Option 1: Context-Aware Prefill**:
  - Prefill chunks with preceding context
  - Maintain hidden state continuity
  - Only store relevant KV portions

- [ ] **Option 2: Streaming KV Cache**:
  - Implement true streaming with state carryover
  - Maintain running statistics for layer norm
  - Progressive KV cache building

- [ ] **Option 3: Checkpoint-Based Approach**:
  - Save model state at chunk boundaries
  - Restore state when continuing generation
  - Ensure perfect continuity

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Implement chosen approach
- [ ] Update chunk prefill logic
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing API
- [ ] Maintain performance characteristics

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Verify identical outputs between modes
- [ ] Test with various chunk configurations
- [ ] Ensure system prompts work correctly
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Success Criteria
1. Chunked generation produces byte-identical output to standard generation
2. Model generates coherent, contextually appropriate responses
3. System prompts are properly attended to
4. Performance overhead is acceptable

## Alternative: Reconsider Chunking Strategy
If isolated prefill proves fundamentally incompatible:
1. Implement sliding window attention
2. Use continuous generation with periodic cache compression
3. Explore other memory-efficient attention mechanisms
