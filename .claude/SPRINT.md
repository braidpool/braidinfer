# Sprint Plan: KV Cache Management System Repair - COMPLETED

**Goal:** ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed the critical K shape mismatch error that prevented chunked inference from working.

**Problem Analysis:**

The root cause of the chunked inference failure was a fundamental mismatch in the KV cache management system. The page manager's `append_kv_to_cache` method was calculating expected token counts incorrectly for chunked sequences, leading to assertion failures when validating K/V tensor shapes.

**Key Issues Identified & Fixed:**

1. **K Shape Mismatch Error:** The page manager expected K/V tensors to match the full context length (including chunks), but in chunked mode, only the generation prompt tokens were being processed in the current forward pass.

2. **Sequence Length Calculation:** The system wasn't properly distinguishing between:
   - Full context length (chunks + generation prompt)
   - Actual tokens being processed (generation prompt only)

**Sprint Tasks - COMPLETED:**

1. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identified that `append_kv_to_cache` was using incorrect token count validation
   - Found that chunked sequences have `_full_context_length` attribute but only process subset of tokens

2. ✅ **Fix Implementation:**
   - Modified `nanovllm/engine/page_manager.py` to handle chunked sequences correctly
   - Added logic to distinguish between full context length and actual processed tokens
   - Updated K/V shape validation to use appropriate token count for chunked vs regular sequences

3. ✅ **Verification:**
   - Confirmed chunked inference now works without immediate crashes
   - Validated that K shape mismatch error is resolved
   - Basic generation is functional

**Results:**
- ✅ Core chunked inference functionality restored
- ✅ K shape mismatch error eliminated
- ✅ System can generate coherent text using chunked KV cache

**Status:** SPRINT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Next Sprint Recommendations:**
- Investigate remaining edge cases in continued generation
- Optimize chunked attention performance
- Add comprehensive test coverage for chunked scenarios
