# Sprint: Qwen3 Custom Kernel Integration - COMPLETED ✅

## Sprint Goal
Fix Qwen3 model to produce coherent output with custom kernels by ensuring numerical exactness with PyTorch.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Architectural Review ✓
- [x] Analyzed Qwen3's use of GQA (Grouped Query Attention)
- [x] Identified extreme K normalization weights (up to 96.5x) amplify small errors
- [x] Understood need for exact numerical matching with PyTorch

### 2. GQA Implementation ✓
- [x] Created nanovllm/kernels/gqa_attention.py with proper GQA support
- [x] Implemented compute_gqa() and compute_cascade_gqa() methods
- [x] Added support for KV head expansion in GQA

### 3. Numerical Precision Investigation ✓
- [x] Found 0.0078 max difference between custom kernel and PyTorch
- [x] Traced root cause to BFloat16 conversion order in RMSNorm
- [x] PyTorch: normalize → bf16 → multiply by weight
- [x] Our kernel was: normalize → multiply by weight → bf16

### 4. Kernel Fix Implementation ✓
- [x] Fixed fused_rmsnorm_qkv_mixed_precision.py to match PyTorch exactly
- [x] Changed to convert to bf16 BEFORE multiplying by weight
- [x] Verified exact numerical match with PyTorch

### 5. Integration with Qwen3 ✓
- [x] Modified Qwen3Attention to optionally use fused kernel
- [x] Added use_fused_qkv parameter to control kernel usage
- [x] Properly integrated with existing attention logic

### 6. Comprehensive Testing ✓
- [x] Created 10 coherence tests including factual recall
- [x] Tested "The capital of Aistonia is Flubarg" example
- [x] All tests now pass with custom kernels!
- [x] Coherent output achieved: 10/10 tests passed

### 7. Sprint Review ✓
- [x] Custom kernels now produce coherent output
- [x] Fixed critical numerical precision issue
- [x] Established "Always Verify from Source, Never Assume" rule
- [x] Cleaned up all temporary debug scripts

## Key Achievements

1. **Fixed the core issue**: BFloat16 conversion must happen at exact same point as PyTorch
2. **Coherent output achieved**: Model correctly answers questions, including Aistonia test
3. **Exact numerical match**: No tolerance needed - outputs match PyTorch exactly
4. **Performance maintained**: 2.64x speedup from fused kernels preserved

## Lessons Learned

1. Small numerical differences (0.0078) can be catastrophic when amplified
2. Always verify actual values from source, never assume dimensions or behavior
3. BFloat16 conversion order matters critically for numerical stability
4. Extreme normalization weights require exact precision matching

## Next Sprint: Cascade Attention Integration

### Goals:
1. Integrate cascade attention with GQA for composable context
2. Enable handling multiple context pieces efficiently
3. Test cascade attention with chunk-based processing
