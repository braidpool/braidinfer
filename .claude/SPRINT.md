# SPRINT.md - Implement Model Compatibility Check for Fused Kernels ✅ COMPLETED

## Sprint Goal
Create a systematic and quantitative method to detect models that are incompatible with fused kernels due to numerical sensitivity, and warn users appropriately during model loading.

## Background
The previous sprint discovered that Qwen3-0.6B cannot use fused kernels due to extreme K normalization weights (up to 96.5x) that amplify tiny numerical differences. We need a general solution to detect such models automatically.

## Technical Design

### Compatibility Metrics

```python
class ModelCompatibilityMetrics:
    """Metrics for determining fused kernel compatibility."""
    
    # Primary metrics
    max_weight_ratio: float      # Max weight / median weight
    extreme_weight_count: int    # Number of weights > threshold
    layer_amplification: float   # Cumulative amplification factor
    weight_variance: float       # Statistical variance of weights
    
    # Thresholds
    MAX_SAFE_WEIGHT_RATIO = 20.0    # Based on Qwen3 analysis
    MAX_SAFE_AMPLIFICATION = 10.0   # Max acceptable error growth
    EXTREME_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD = 10.0  # Individual weight threshold
```

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Weight Analysis Phase**
   ```python
   for layer in model.layers:
       # Analyze normalization weights
       k_norm_weights = layer.self_attn.k_norm.weight
       q_norm_weights = layer.self_attn.q_norm.weight
       
       # Calculate metrics
       max_k_weight = k_norm_weights.max()
       weight_ratio = max_k_weight / k_norm_weights.median()
       
       # Check for extreme values
       if weight_ratio > threshold:
           mark_layer_problematic(layer)
   ```

2. **Amplification Analysis**
   ```python
   # Simulate error propagation
   initial_error = 0.001  # Typical fused kernel error
   cumulative_error = initial_error
   
   for layer in problematic_layers:
       amplification = layer.max_weight
       cumulative_error *= amplification
       
   if cumulative_error > 1.0:
       model_incompatible = True
   ```

3. **Compatibility Score**
   ```python
   score = weighted_sum(
       weight_ratio_score * 0.4,
       amplification_score * 0.3,
       layer_count_score * 0.2,
       variance_score * 0.1
   )
   
   if score < 0.5:
       return "INCOMPATIBLE"
   elif score < 0.8:
       return "WARNING"
   else:
       return "COMPATIBLE"
   ```

### Integration Points

1. **Model Loading Hook**
   ```python
   class Qwen3ForCausalLM(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, config, use_custom_kernels=False):
           super().__init__()
           # ... normal initialization ...
           
           if use_custom_kernels:
               compatibility = check_fused_kernel_compatibility(self)
               if compatibility == "INCOMPATIBLE":
                   logger.error(f"Model incompatible with fused kernels: {compatibility.reason}")
                   raise ValueError("Cannot use fused kernels with this model")
               elif compatibility == "WARNING":
                   logger.warning(f"Fused kernels may cause issues: {compatibility.reason}")
   ```

2. **CLI Integration**
   ```bash
   # Check compatibility without loading
   python -m nanovllm.check_compatibility ~/models/qwen3-0.6b
   
   # Force override (for testing)
   python chat.py --model qwen3 --use-custom-kernels --force-fused-kernels
   ```

### Expected Outputs

1. **Compatibility Report**
   ```
   Model Compatibility Report
   ==========================
   Model: Qwen3-0.6B
   Status: INCOMPATIBLE
   
   Issues Found:
   - Layer 0: K norm max weight = 96.5 (threshold: 20.0)
   - Layer 1: K norm max weight = 44.5 (threshold: 20.0)
   - 16/28 layers have extreme weights
   - Estimated error amplification: 1351x
   
   Recommendation: Use standard kernels only
   ```

2. **Warning Message**
   ```
   WARNING: This model has extreme normalization weights that make it 
   incompatible with fused kernels. Falling back to standard kernels.
   
   To see detailed compatibility report, run:
   python -m nanovllm.check_compatibility <model_path>
   ```

2. **Provides quantitative scoring** (0.0-1.0) with three status levels
3. **Integrates seamlessly** with model loading process
4. **Offers clear user feedback** through CLI and programmatic interfaces

### Key Deliverables

1. **FusedKernelCompatibilityChecker** (`nanovllm/utils/kernel_compatibility.py`)
   - Analyzes K/Q normalization weights
   - Calculates error amplification
   - Provides compatibility scoring

2. **CLI Tool** (`python -m nanovllm.utils.check_compatibility_cli`)
   - Standalone compatibility checking
   - Verbose analysis mode
   - Report export functionality

3. **Integration Examples**
   - `qwen3_with_compatibility.py`: Model class integration
   - `model_loader_with_compatibility.py`: Loader integration
   - `check_compatibility.sh`: Automation script

4. **Documentation**
   - `docs/KERNEL_COMPATIBILITY.md`: User guide
   - `FUSED_KERNEL_ANALYSIS.md`: Technical analysis

### Validation

- Correctly identifies Qwen3-0.6B as INCOMPATIBLE (96.5x weights)
- Synthetic tests show proper WARNING/COMPATIBLE detection
- Exit codes enable scripting and automation

This system prevents users from experiencing gibberish output by automatically detecting and warning about models that are too numerically sensitive for fused kernels.
