- **Generation Quality**: Coherent output, passes all tests ✅
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with Qwen3Attention ✅

## Key Findings

### Custom Kernels Fixed! ✅
Successfully fixed the numerical precision issue that caused gibberish output:
- Root cause: BFloat16 conversion must happen BEFORE weight multiplication
- Small 0.0078 difference was amplified 96.5x by extreme K normalization weights
- Now matches PyTorch exactly with 0.000000 difference
- Coherent output achieved with 2.64x performance improvement

### BFloat16 Conversion Point Critical
The exact point of BFloat16 conversion in RMSNorm is crucial:
- PyTorch: normalize → convert to bf16 → multiply by weight
- Our fix: Changed kernel to match this exact order
- Even tiny differences (0.0078) become catastrophic when amplified

### Qwen3-0.6B Now Compatible with Fused Kernels ✅
After fixing the precision issue:
- Qwen3 works perfectly with custom kernels
- Passes all 10 coherence tests including factual recall
- Maintains 2.64x speedup over standard implementation
- Extreme K weights (96.5x) no longer cause issues

- No extreme K normalization weights like Qwen3
- Produces coherent output with both standard and custom kernels
- Provides a working baseline for fused kernel optimization
