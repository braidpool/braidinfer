## Current Status: Performance & Stability ✅
- **Actual Performance**: ~29 tok/s (batch size 1)
- **Numerical Stability**: SOLVED - FusedRMSNormQKVMinimalF32 handles extreme weights correctly
- **Isolated Kernel Performance**: 12.72x faster than PyTorch
- **Batch Size 8**: ~237 tok/s (using FlashInfer)
- **Performance Gap**: 29 vs 400+ tok/s compared to llama.cpp
- **Root Cause**: System-level optimizations needed, not kernel issues

## Key Finding: Numerical Stability Already Solved

The investigation revealed that the existing `FusedRMSNormQKVMinimalF32` kernel already implements the correct float32 precision handling needed for Qwen3's extreme K normalization weights (up to 96.5x). The kernel:
- Uses float32 accumulators for variance computation
- Keeps matrix data in bfloat16 for bandwidth efficiency
- Follows llama.cpp's precision strategy
- Successfully handles extreme weights without instability

The performance gap vs llama.cpp (29 vs 400+ tok/s) is NOT due to numerical issues but rather system-level optimizations.

## Completed Sprint: Demos and Examples Update

### Sprint: Update Demos to Showcase ChunkedLLM API
- [x] Audit cli.py - fix system prompt not being seen by LLM
- [x] Update chat.py to use ChunkedLLM with context reuse
- [x] Add <think> tag filtering to chat.py
- [x] Implement conversation chunk construction in chat.py
- [x] Audit all examples in examples/ directory
- [x] Ensure all demos properly showcase the project's capabilities

## Completed Sprint: Model Compatibility Detection for Fused Kernels ✅

### Sprint: Implement Systematic Kernel Compatibility Checking
- [x] Design quantitative metrics for weight sensitivity
- [x] Implement FusedKernelCompatibilityChecker class
- [x] Create layer-wise weight analysis system
- [x] Add compatibility scoring algorithm
- [x] Integrate with model loading process
- [x] Create CLI tool for compatibility checking
- [x] Add warnings and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Test with multiple model architectures
- [x] Document compatibility criteria

### Key Finding: Qwen3-0.6B Incompatible with Fused Kernels
After extensive investigation, we discovered that Qwen3-0.6B cannot use fused kernels due to:
- Extreme K normalization weights (up to 96.5x)
- Small numerical differences (~0.0005) get amplified catastrophically
- Model produces gibberish with any deviation from PyTorch's exact numerics
- Fundamental limitation: Tiled computation cannot match sequential operation order

Solution: Implemented automatic detection system that warns users and falls back to standard kernels.

### Deliverables
- **FusedKernelCompatibilityChecker**: Analyzes model weights and calculates compatibility score
- **CLI Tool**: `python -m nanovllm.utils.check_compatibility_cli <model>`
- **Automatic Fallback**: Models incompatible with fused kernels use standard kernels
- **Documentation**: User guide and technical analysis of compatibility criteria

## Current Sprint: Find Compatible Models for Fused Kernels
