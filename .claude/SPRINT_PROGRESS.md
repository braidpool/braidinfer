# Sprint Progress: Fix Chunked Attention Correctness

## Completed Tasks ✓

### Phase 1: Debug Output Cleanup ✓
- Reduced debug logging in chunked generation
- Commented out excessive print statements
- Made output cleaner and easier to analyze

### Phase 2: Correctness Testing Framework ✓
- Created comparison test suite (test_chunked_correctness.py)
- Implemented side-by-side testing of standard vs chunked
- Added token-level comparison
- Created debugging tools

### Phase 3: Investigation and Analysis ✓
- **Token Structure**: Fixed chunks to include chat template markers
- **KV Cache Access**: Fixed seq_lengths to allow access to chunk KV cache
- **Attention Mechanism**: Modified attention to try to access chunk KV cache
- **Position Encoding**: Identified position encoding mismatch as core issue

## Key Findings

1. **Standard generation works perfectly** - Produces coherent English with `<think>` tags
2. **Chunked generation is fundamentally broken** - Produces wrong content or gibberish
3. **Root cause identified**: Position encoding mismatch between chunk prefill and generation

## Current Status

The chunked attention mechanism requires a complete redesign because:
- Chunks are prefilled with local positions (0-16, 0-11)
- Generation expects global positions (0-31)
- Standard attention can't handle this mismatch
- The custom chunk kernel only works for single-token decode

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Option 1**: Implement proper cascade attention mechanism
2. **Option 2**: Fix position encoding handling in chunks
3. **Option 3**: Simplify to regenerate full context (lose performance)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- test_chunked_correctness.py
- test_token_comparison.py
- test_chunked_correctness_fixed.py
- debug_attention_issue.py
- debug_chunk_kv.py
- test_standard_generation.py
- CHUNKED_ATTENTION_ISSUE_SUMMARY.md

### Modified:
- nanovllm/chunked_llm.py (reduced debug output)
- nanovllm/engine/llm_engine.py (fixed seq_lengths, reduced debug)
- nanovllm/engine/model_runner.py (reduced debug output)
- nanovllm/layers/attention.py (added chunk KV access)

## Conclusion

While we successfully identified and documented the core issues, fixing chunked generation requires architectural changes beyond simple bug fixes. The standard attention mechanism is incompatible with the chunked KV cache approach without proper position encoding handling.
