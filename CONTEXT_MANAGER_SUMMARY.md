# Context Manager Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Context Manager for nano-vLLM has been successfully implemented with the following key features:

1. **Chunk Management**: Track and manage text chunks by SHA256 hash
2. **KV Cache Population**: Properly populate KV cache for loaded chunks
3. **Activation/Deactivation**: Control which chunks are used during inference
4. **Virtual Block Table**: Filter blocks without data movement
5. **Output Tracking**: Automatically track model outputs as chunks
6. **Proper Context Integration**: Use system messages to provide context

## Key Components

### 1. Context Manager (`nanovllm/engine/context_manager.py`)
- Main class that manages all chunks
- Tracks chunks by SHA256 hash for content-based addressing
- Supports activation/deactivation without deletion
- Provides `build_prompt_with_context()` to properly format prompts with active chunks

### 2. Block Manager Extensions (`nanovllm/engine/block_manager.py`)
- Extended Block class with activation state and metadata
- SHA256 hashing for content addressing
- Reference counting for safe memory management

### 3. Virtual Block Table (`nanovllm/engine/virtual_block_table.py`)
- Maps virtual to physical blocks for efficient filtering
- Enables selective attention without data movement
- Falls back to eager mode when filtering is active (CUDA graphs incompatible)

### 4. CLI Integration (`cli.py`)
- Comprehensive slash commands for chunk management:
  - `/load <file>` - Load file as context chunk
  - `/context` - Show detailed chunk status
  - `/activate <hash>` - Activate chunk
  - `/deactivate <hash>` - Deactivate chunk
  - `/populate <hash>` - Pre-populate KV cache
  - `/compose <h1> <h2>...` - Combine chunks
  - `/tag <hash> <tag>` - Tag chunks
  - `/save <hash>` - Save to disk
  - `/restore <hash>` - Restore from disk
  - `/delete <hash>` - Remove chunk
  - `/clear` - Clear all chunks

### 5. KV Cache Population
- `_populate_chunk_kv_cache()` method runs forward pass to compute K/V values
- Uses allocated blocks and proper slot mapping
- Integrates with flash_attn's `store_kvcache()` function

### 6. Context Integration
- Active chunks are formatted as system messages
- `build_prompt_with_context()` creates properly formatted prompts
- Maintains chat template compatibility

## Usage Example

```python
# Load context
chunk = context_mgr.add_chunk("The capital of France is Lyon.", tokenizer, populate_cache=True)

# Build prompt with context
formatted = context_mgr.build_prompt_with_context(
    [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    tokenizer
)

# Generate with context
response = llm.generate([formatted], sampling_params)
```

## Testing
Two test scripts validate the implementation:
- `test_kv_population.py` - Tests KV cache population
- `test_context_usage.py` - Tests context actually affects generation

## Pending Features
1. **Memory Hierarchy**: Moving chunks between GPU/CPU/disk
2. **KV Cache Persistence**: Saving actual K/V tensors to disk

## Architecture Notes
- Context chunks are managed separately from the inference pipeline
- KV cache population uses the same code path as normal prefill
- Virtual block table provides zero-copy filtering
- Output tracking automatically captures generated text as chunks
- System message formatting ensures proper context integration
